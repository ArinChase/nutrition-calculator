# Nutrition Calculator (By _Arin Chase_)
This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that specializes in server-side rendering and fast, static-page generation. Coupled with Vercel's free serverless hosting, the project is continously deployed from the [github link](https://github.com/ArinChase/nutrition-calculator) which greatly speeds up the process of updates.

# How the nutrition calculator works
This is a simple program that gets nutrition api data from [nutritionix](https://nutritionix.com). It displays it asychronously using  a React hook. The web page was also built mobile and SEO friendly by utilizing the chrome developer tools.

# Live deployment
This application is running live on my website @ [arinchase.com](https://arinchase.com).
